# Computational Intelligence Assignments  

This repository contains all the assignments and projects regarding computational intelligence problem-solving.


## Installation

Each python script or pyhton notebook can be downloaded as a standalone script and run.

## Usage

Most scripts require no input on the user's side in terms of command line arguments.  
Those who do, will ask for them interactively.

## Contributing
Contribution to the project is welcome, although the project won't be maintained in the future.
